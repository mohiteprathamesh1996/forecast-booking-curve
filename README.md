# Dynamic Booking Curve Forecasting
### A Shiny Application for Forecasting Airline Booking Trends

---

## Overview
This repository contains an **R Shiny** application designed to analyze and forecast airline **booking curves** dynamically. It leverages **time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, Modeltime)** to predict seat sales and provides **AI-driven revenue insights** using **OpenAI's API**.

The application allows users to:
- **Visualize historical booking trends** for specific routes  
- **Analyze demand patterns** using interactive plots  
- **Forecast future bookings** with machine learning models  
- **Assess model performance** with accuracy metrics  
- **Generate AI-based commercial insights** for revenue management  

---

## Features
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Select departure dates and routes for analysis.
- **Historical Data Insights**: Visualizes past booking trends.
- **Forecasting Models**: ARIMA, Prophet (with and without regressors).
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Powered by `ggplot2` & `plotly`.
- **AI-Generated Insights**: OpenAI integration for strategic recommendations.
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Accuracy assessment using `modeltime`.
